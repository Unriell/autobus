{"name":"Autobus","tagline":"An enhanced event bus for Android projects","body":"**Autobus** is an enhanced event bus intended to allow communication between decoupled parts of an application.\r\n\r\nIt is based on concepts from [Otto][1], [EventBus][2] and [RxJava][3].\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n------------------------------\r\nWe developed our own Event Bus to cover two main needs that aren't covered by existing libraries:\r\n\r\n* __Decouple channels and emitted data__\r\n\r\nBoth Otto and EventBus use Events (defined classes) to carry data and also to represent the channel the subscribers\r\nare listening to. This approach is valid but it is quite inflexible. \r\n\r\nAutobus allows representing channels as Strings and\r\ndata as a separate class; this way a subscriber can listen to a channel expecting a concrete class of data (or even Any class\r\nof data) and emitters can send data of a concrete class (or no data at all) to a concrete channel. When an emitter sends data of\r\nclass D to a channel C, every subscriber listening to channel C and expecting data of class D is notified. Also subscribers\r\nlistening to channel C and expecting data of any class are notified.\r\n\r\n* __Explicit contract between subscribers and emitters__\r\n\r\nAs one of the common use case of Event Buses is the communication between _interactors_ (asynchronous core operations of an app) and _presenters_ (adapters between _views_ and _interactors_) it is desirable to maintain an explicit definition or contract between the emitters and the subscribers. Autobus accomplishes this task with BusObservable API. A _interactor_ can return a BusObservable instance and subscribers can directly be subscribed to this observable; the observable is the contract itself as it defines the _Bus_, the _Channel_ and also the data that will be emitted. \r\n\r\n\r\nOk, what else?\r\n------------------------------\r\n* Full annotated with @Nullable and @NotNull.\r\n* Clean code enforcement by strong typing. No need for upcasting/downcasting any object.\r\n* Autocomplete heaven (related to this string typing).\r\n\r\nComparison\r\n----------\r\n| Functionality                   | EventBus        | Otto        | Autobus                           |\r\n| --------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------- |\r\n| Declare event handling methods  | Name Convention | Annotations | Explicity                         |\r\n| Event inheritance               | Yes             | Yes         | No                                |\r\n| Cache most recent events        | Yes (sticky)    | No          | Yes (persistent emmit)            |\r\n| Event producers                 | No              | Yes         | No                                |\r\n| Event delivery in posting thread| Yes             | Yes         | Yes                               |\r\n| Event delivery in main thread   | Yes             | No          | Yes (using preprocessor)          |\r\n| Event delivery in bg thread     | Yes             | No          | Yes                               |\r\n| Aynchronous event delivery      | Yes             | No          | Yes                               |\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n------\r\nWe are working to make this lib available in a Maven repository.\r\nFor the moment you can find the latest stable JAR in the root of this GitHub repo as autobus-0.1.0.jar or\r\nyou can build the JAR file yourself from the source code.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n--------\r\nYou can use Autobus in two different ways:\r\n\r\n## * __Using Bus API__\r\nWhen you want direct access to Autobus basic API and are not worried about a strong contract.\r\n\r\n* Define data (you could also use your own classes or even String, Integer...):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class LocationChangedBusData { /* Additional fields if needed */ }\r\n```\r\n  * Prepare listeners expecting a concrete class of data:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate BusListener<LocationChangedBusData> locationChangedEventListener1 = new BusListener<LocationChangedBusData>(LocationChangedBusData.class) {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void notifyEvent(@NotNull LocationChangedBusData busData) { // Notice the strong typed not-null parameter\r\n            onLocationChanged(busData);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * ... or any class of data at all (will be notified even if there is the data is null):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate BusListener locationChangedEventListener2 = new BusAnyDataListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void notifyEvent(@Nullable Object busData) { // In this case there is no string typing, and the data could be null \r\n            onLocationChanged();\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Subscribe listener to a bus (should be injected) and a channel, expecting a concrete class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbus.subscribe(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", locationChangedEventListener1);\r\nbus.subscribe(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", locationChangedEventListener2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Post events with data (both previously defined listeners will be notified):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbus.emitEvent(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", new LocationChangedBusData());\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * ... or post events without data (only locationChangedEventListener2 will be notified):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbus.emitEvent(\"TEST_CHANNEL\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## * __Using BusObservable API__\r\nWhen you prefer defining a strong contract between subscribers and emitters (leads to cleaner and safer code) use this approach.\r\n  \r\n* Define data (you could also use your own classes or even String, Integer...):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class LocationChangedBusData { /* Additional fields if needed */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Define BusObservable passing a channel and a bus (should be injected) and specifying the class that will be emitted through it. Only listeners expecting that class of data will be able to subscribe to this observable. And all the data emitted through this observable will be of the same class. Strong contract!\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBusObservable<LocationChangedBusData> busObservable = new BusObservable<>(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", bus);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * ... you could also define a BusObservable without specifying a concrete class of data:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBusObservable busObservable = new BusObservable(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", bus);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Prepare listeners expecting a concrete class of data:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate BusListener<LocationChangedBusData> locationChangedEventListener1 = new BusListener<LocationChangedBusData>(LocationChangedBusData.class) {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void notifyEvent(@NotNull LocationChangedBusData busData) { // Notice the strong typed not-null parameter\r\n            onLocationChanged(busData);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Subscribe listener to the BusObservable. Only listeners expecting *LocationChangedBusData* will be able to subscribe to this BusObservable:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbusObservable.subscribe(listener);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Post events with data using BusObservable. Only data of class *LocationChangedBusData* can be emitted using this BusObservable:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbusObservable.emitEvent(new BusDataSample());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Need persistent events? We got you covered\r\n\r\n* You can just emit an event or you can emit **persistent** events. Persistent events are notified to new matching subscribers as soon as they subscribe to the channel.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbus.emitPersistentEvent(\"TEST_CHANNEL\", new LocationChangedBusData());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Need to execute your callback in the **main thread**? Here we go...\r\n\r\n* You can define a Preprocessor for your listeners (both BusListener and BusAnyDataListener). This preprocessor will act as an interceptor that will receive every notification intended for the listener. You can build any kind of preprocessing of the data there or even force the listener's *notifyEvent* to be executed on the main thread:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ForceMainThreadPreprocessor<T> implements BusListener.Preprocessor<T> {\r\n\r\n    final Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void notifyEvent(final @NotNull BusListener<T> listener, final @NotNull T busData) {\r\n        // Force listener's notifyEvent to be executed on the main thread.\r\n        handler.post(new Runnable() {\r\n            @Override public void run() {\r\n                listener.notifyEvent(busData);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull documentation\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n## Class Bus\r\n\r\nEvent bus. \r\n\r\n* Supports different channels and events sent to each channel containing data of different classes or no data at all. BusListeners subscribed to a concrete channel and expecting a concrete class will be notified when a event containing a data object of that class is emitted to that channel.\r\n\r\n* Supports persistent events that are notified to new matching subscribers as soon as they subscribe to the appropriate channel.\r\n\r\n#### `Bus()`\r\n\r\nCreates a new Bus instance.\r\n\r\n#### `boolean isLoggingEnabled()`\r\n\r\nCheck whether logging is enabled for this bus.
